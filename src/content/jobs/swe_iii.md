## About the position

Google's software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our products need to handle information at massive scale, and extend well beyond web search. We're looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project critical to Google’s needs with opportunities to switch teams and projects as you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to take on new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.

In this role, you will manage project priorities, deadlines, and deliverables. You will design, develop, test, deploy, maintain, and enhance software solutions.

The Core team builds the technical foundation behind Google’s flagship products. We are owners and advocates for the underlying design elements, developer platforms, product components, and infrastructure at Google. These are the essential building blocks for excellent, safe, and coherent experiences for our users and drive the pace of innovation for every developer. We look across Google’s products to build central solutions, break down technical barriers and strengthen existing systems. As the Core team, we have a mandate and a unique opportunity to impact important technical decisions across the company.

## Our values

### Mentorship

Upon joining Google, you will be paired with a formal mentor,
who will help guide you in the process of ramping up, forging relationships,
and learning the systems you'll need to do your job.
Your manager can also help you find mentors who can coach you
as you navigate your career at Google. In addition to formal mentors,
we work and train together so that we are always learning from one another,
and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

### Inclusion

Here on the Flutter team and at Google, we embrace our differences
and are [committed to furthering our culture of inclusion](https://flutter.dev/culture).
In addition to groups like the [Flutteristas](https://flutteristas.org/),
[Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)](https://diversity.google/commitments/)
are employee-initiated networks for supporting underrepresented employees
and their allies with shared values of creating belonging 
across their communities and Google.

### Work-Life Balance

Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance.
Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life
is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren't focused
on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead,
we're happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive and
well-balanced life—both in and outside of work.
